# BTP-MICRO-MSP

In the main there is the programming and activation of the different peripherals for an ATMEL-432 microcontroller, 
at the same time there is the communication architecture for the different types of RAK most common in the industry, 
in order to communicate the microcontroller to technology LoRa and implement a LoraWAN communication for sending data (amount of liters, 
battery level, transmission time) in order to implement a telemetry project in the different aqueducts of the country.


The compiler recommended by ATMEL for the programming of microcontrollers is implemented, in turn the use of the C language is implemented.
